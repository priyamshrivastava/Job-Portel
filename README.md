# Job-Portel
 🏢 Job Insider - Your Gateway to Opportunities 🌟 Job Insider is my first-ever project where I’ve explored and learned a lot about web development and full-stack programming! 🚀 This job portal aims to bridge the gap between job seekers and recruiters efficiently.  📋 Key Features: 🔐 User Authentication:  Users can securely sign in through their Gmail accounts. Recruiters also have dedicated sign-in access. 📄 Resume Submission:  Job seekers can easily submit their resumes for their desired roles. ✅ Resume Approval System:  Recruiters can review and approve resumes based on qualifications and role requirements. 🛠️ Technologies Used: Frontend:  HTML CSS ReactJS JavaScript Backend:  Yet to be expanded further as the project progresses. 🚧 Current Status: The project is still in progress, with exciting updates planned! Future enhancements will include improved role management, notification systems, and more! ✨ This journey has been a tremendous learning experience, and I’m excited to keep growing this project. Contributions, feedback, and ideas are always welcome! 🎉
